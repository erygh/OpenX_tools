if no selection is made and the user doesn't touch the toggle, set DEC value to DAFFC

if the user enters a color and selects HEX, verify that the entry is 8-characters long, convert the value to DEC and store as the main variable.
if the user enters a color and selects DEC, verify that the value is 8-characters long and store as the main variable.

When "generate alt text" button is clicked, first check to ensure that the bgcolor is either "" or eight characters long.  If it is not 8-characters long, throw an error.

  sharing differs between versions
  number of servers differs between versions
  avg revenue per paid user: 
  this is his first deal with a distribution partner
  what revenue share does he feel is fair?  Ro proposed 40%, they came back with 17%
  Ro threw out estimate of 1000 paid 
  Lifetime value of users estimate based on 3 month
  9450 / 1600 impressions 
  Fixed costs low, variable costs high, VAT impacts
Lifetime committment at 20%?  Greg is going to talk to his partners.
Plan is to tie Paypal email ID to our transaction


Malwarebites- creative currently says "Check "Yes" to download".  That doesn't really make sense for the companion unit as there is no "Yes" button.  Would you like us to take this line out?
